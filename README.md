# UXTC
Firstly, UXTC, short for University of Xian and Technology of China, has no relation with the USTC we know :)  
UXTC is an open source world, where Chemistry and Biology and so on are strangely more important than Computer Science. To creat such a wonderful world, we use elements from traditional culture such as yin and yang, xian.
You can use this world to creat your own story, with additional settings or even modified settings, as long as you clearly pointed out what are your settings
