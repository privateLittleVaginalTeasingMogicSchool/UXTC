# UXTC
## Intro
Firstly, **UXTC**, short for *University of Xian and Technology of China*, has no relation with the **USTC** you know :)  

UXTC is an open source world, `where Chemistry and Biology and so on are strangely more important than Computer Science.` To creat such a wonderful world, we use elements from traditional culture such as yin and yang, xian.  

## What you can do
You can use this world to **creat your own story**, with additional settings or even modified settings, **as long as you clearly pointed out what are your settings.**  

We **recommend** you to use `Markdown` to show your settings and timeline.  

## Just Start
You can simplely copy the template to start your creation! The structure of template lists here:
```
|-+ template\
  |-- settings.md
  |-- timeline.md
  |-+ story\
    |-- index.md (optional)
    |-- 01.txt
    |-- 02.txt
    |-- 03.txt
```
You just need to build your own `settings` and `timeline` and write your story in `story` folder. Or even write a single file named `stroy.txt` directly.
